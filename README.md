# PROJECT: SIGN-UP FORM

## A Brief Introduction
In this first repository from The Odin Project Full Stack JavaScript curriculum under the Intermediate HTML and CSS course, I will build a sign-up form for an imaginary service to flex some of the new items I've learned.


## Learning goal
- Create forms with HTML
- Have a basic idea of how to style forms
- Know how to explain what form validations are
- Know how to use a few of the basic built-in HTML validations
- Know how to build custom validations


## Sign-Up Form Feature
- Name Formatter
- Phone Number Formatter


#### Reflection/Outcome
As I followed the instruction and completed the basic setup of this Sign-Up Form project in HTML and CSS, I decided to go further by adding a JavaScript custom validation. I used JS RegExp in the custom validation to ensure that the user will input the correct information in the input field.
